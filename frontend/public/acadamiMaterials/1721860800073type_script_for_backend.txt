type script backend

first install type script 

create index.ts file

then install type decorations  by writing

npm i @types/express @types/node


then create new tsconfig file by using npx tsc --init

then change the  outdir to 

"outDir":"./dist"

then run npx tsc again to install globally and dist folder appears 
and inside dist folder indx.js folder appears
then run nodemon  dist/index.js  file to run the file

1.then write this on package.json file of scripts section
"build":"npx tsc"
"start":"node dist/index.js"

then npm run build 
then npm run start
after installing nodemon

add 
"dev":"tsc -w & nodemon dist/index.js"

then npm run dev to execute 
t

then  install rimraf to automatically delete on dist folder 
for me if only watch mode works properly
add this in adition to above on scripts
"build" "rimraf dist && npx tsc"

or we can create "prestart":"npm run build" in order to run before npm start with out writing npm run build and when we write npm start command prestart executes automatically
npx tsc for ompiling typescript to java script
also change dev to serve and wwrite "preserve":"npm run build" such that when we type npm run serve npm run build runs before it .
